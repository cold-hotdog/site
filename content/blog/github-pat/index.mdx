We can mention the Github personal access token’s name and the scopes in the query params.

Eg: `https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?description=new-token&scopes=public_repo,workflow,user:email,gist`

Can be used in your project’s readme when you want the user to generate a Github PAT with specific scopes.
