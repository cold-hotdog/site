I am not a fan of Google analytics. It feels bloated, even more so for a personal website. After going through a lot of it's alternatives, I think that [umami](https://github.com/mikecao/umami) is one of the best choices. Umami is self hosted and in this article I'll go through the steps of setting it up. I hosted the umami client on vercel and the database on a digitalocean droplet. I didn't opted for managed database in digitalocean because I plan to play around with the VPS in the future(maybe self-host an email client).

# Setting up database server

I am assuming that you have provisioned an Ubuntu VPS on digitalocean (or any other cloud provider of your choice). First we'll do some setup.
SSH as root user into the droplet.

## Basic setup for a fresh VPS

Update the package index and upgrade versions.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

Create a new user with admin privileges.

```bash
adduser mak
usermod -aG sudo mak
```

Copy the ssh keys from root to the new user.

```bash
rsync --archive --chown=mak:mak ~/.ssh /home/mak
```

Now relogin as this new user instead of root ([it's a best practice](https://askubuntu.com/a/16179)).

Setup a basic firewal and allow ssh and database connections.

```bash
sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
sudo ufw allow 3306
sudo ufw enable
```

## Install and start MySQL server

```bash
sudo apt install mysql-server
sudo systemctl start mysql.service
```

Run the following command to configure MySQL. It will prompt self-explanatory questions. It's recommended to accept all of them.

```bash
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

## Create a new MySQL user.

Open the MySQL shell

```bash
sudo mysql
```

Create a user and grant privileges

```
CREATE USER 'mak'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY '<your-password>';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'mak'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;
```

Here `%` is a wildcard which signifies that _mak_ can connect with the server from any host.

Exit the shell by entering `exit`.

## Allow remote connections to mysql

Open the file `/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf` in your favourite editor and change `bind-address` from `127.0.0.1` to `0.0.0.0`. Restart the MySQL service for this change to take effect by running `sudo systemctl restart mysql`

## Create DB and tables for umami

Open the MySQL shell.

```bash
mysql -u mak -p
```

Create a new DB for umami. I am naming it `umami` but any other name will also work.

```
CREATE DATABASE umami;
```

Create a file named `schema.sql` and paste the sql code written in [umami/sql/schema.mysql.sql](https://github.com/mikecao/umami/blob/master/sql/schema.mysql.sql). Now run the following command to create the required tables.

```bash
mysql -u mak -p umami < schema.sql
```

With this, our database setup is complete.

# Deploying umami on vercel

You will have to fork the [umami repository](https://github.com/mikecao/umami). After that import your fork as a project in [vercel](https://vercel.com/login). Make sure to add the following 2 environment variables.

```
DATABASE_URL=mysql://mak:<your-password>@<vps-ip-address>:3306/umami
HASH_SALT=<random-string>
```

Other settings like build command, build folder can be left as default.

After the deployment is complete, vercel will provide a url. Navigate to `<url>/login`. There is already an account created with the credentials `admin`(username) and `umami`(password) when we created the tables in our db. Login using these credentials and make sure to change your password.

# Start tracking your website

This step is pretty straightforward. In the settings page, add your website. It will give you tracking code which you will have to paste in the `<head>` section of your website. After that umami will start tracking visits to your website. Watch it on your dashboard.
